•	Body: Regular weight, muted gray (#888)
•	Category labels: Small caps, uppercase, tracking-wider, colored with accent colors
•	Left-aligned layouts for editorial sophistication (avoid centered hero sections)
UI Elements:
•	Minimal border-radius (4px) for a sharp, brutalist feel
•	1px borders in #333, transitioning to #444 on hover

•	Buttons: Solid fills (white or mint) with no border-radius or 4px max
•	Colored left-border accents on feature cards (2px)

Layout Principles:
•	Left-aligned hero and section headers
•	Max-width containers (max-w-7xl) with generous padding
•	Generous vertical spacing between sections (py-20 or py-24)
•	Section dividers using subtle top borders (#222)
•	Grid layouts for cards (2-3 columns on desktop)
Interactive States:
•	Border color lightens on hover (#333 → #444)
•	Text color transitions to accent color (mint green) on hover
•	Buttons darken slightly on hover
•	Smooth transitions (transition-colors)
Overall Vibe:
Editorial meets tech startup—serious and professional through the dark palette and left-aligned layouts, but playful through bright accent color pops. Minimal decoration, letting typography and color do the heavy lifting.
