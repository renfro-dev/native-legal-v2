Case Study 1
Fixing Intake Blind Spots at a High-Volume Family Law Firm
Client Profile

Firm Type: Large, multi-office California family law firm
Practice Area: Family Law
Role: Director of Revenue Operations & Growth (in-house)

The Problem

Despite strong brand demand and steady inbound traffic, leadership lacked clear answers to fundamental questions:

How many inquiries are we actually receiving?

Where are we losing potential clients — and why?

Which marketing channels generate retainers, not just leads?

Are intake specialists converting at similar rates?

Are we scaling staff… or masking broken systems?

Intake data lived across voicemail systems, inboxes, forms, calendars, and spreadsheets — creating blind spots that made optimization impossible.

The Approach

Native.Legal redesigned intake as a measurable revenue system, not a call center.

The strategy focused on:

Eliminating manual data entry

Capturing every inquiry automatically

Creating visibility into both lead volume and lead quality

Instrumenting the intake funnel end-to-end

What We Built

A fully systemized intake infrastructure with:

Automated lead creation from calls, voicemails, and web forms

Voicemail transcription logged directly to the CRM

Dynamic form routing based on matter type

Automated conflict checks to remove intake bottlenecks

Compliant call recording with centralized access

Automated follow-up tasks for staff and prospects

Consult confirmation workflows via email automation

Personalized follow-ups based on why a prospect didn’t move forward

Marketing attribution tied directly to retained revenue — not vanity metrics

Critically, intake specialists never had to manually enter data to measure performance.

Results

>200% increase in revenue per intake specialist

+42% increase in conversion rate on direct traffic

Significant lift in paid ads lead volume

>300% increase in paid ads ROI

Clear visibility into when to scale staff vs. cut spend

Actionable insight into why prospects drop off at each stage

Why It Matters

Most firms try to grow by hiring faster or spending more on ads.
This firm grew by seeing the truth in their data — and fixing the system underneath it.

Native.Legal turned intake from a cost center into a predictable revenue engine.

Case Study 2
Building a Scalable, In-House Recruiting Engine for Law Firms
Client Profile

Firm Type: Multi-state law firms
Practice Areas: Litigation, family law, support staff
Role: In-house recruiting leadership

The Problem

Law firms routinely face the same hiring dilemmas:

Should we pay 20% of year-one salary to recruiters?

Why are qualified paralegals so hard to find?

Can we hire strong talent outside our home state?

Are we hiring because we need capacity — or because systems are broken?

How do we know if new hires are actually paying for themselves?

Most firms lacked structure, visibility, and ROI measurement in hiring decisions.

The Approach

Native.Legal treated recruiting like an operations problem, not a staffing one.

The goal was to:

Reduce reliance on external recruiters

Build repeatable hiring pipelines

Tie headcount decisions to real operational demand

Measure ROI on every hire

What We Built

Across multiple firms and jurisdictions, we implemented:

Structured candidate pipelines with defined stages

Hiring manager workflows to reduce interview drag

Out-of-state talent sourcing for cost efficiency

Role clarity frameworks to reduce mis-hires

Onboarding systems aligned with real job success

Headcount justification models (hire vs. automate vs. defer)

Post-hire performance tracking tied to business outcomes

Results

1,000+ legal hires supported across 20+ states

Reduced dependency on external recruiting firms

Faster time-to-hire with higher role alignment

Improved retention through better enablement

Clear insight into when technology beats headcount

Why It Matters

Hiring is one of the most expensive decisions a law firm makes — and most firms make it blind.

Native.Legal gives firms the systems and clarity to scale intelligently, without over-hiring or over-paying.
